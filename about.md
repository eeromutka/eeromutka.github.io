Hello!

My name is Eero Mutka and I'm a student living in the island of Gotland, Visby. I love programming, 3d art, indoor climbing amongst other things. I'm a using the [Jai programming language](https://github.com/Jai-Community/Jai-Community-Library/wiki/) for my projects, though it's still in private beta.

Here is my 3D art portfolio: [https://www.artstation.com/eeromutka](https://www.artstation.com/eeromutka)

(unfortunately I do not have any cool finished coding projects to show as of yet!)
