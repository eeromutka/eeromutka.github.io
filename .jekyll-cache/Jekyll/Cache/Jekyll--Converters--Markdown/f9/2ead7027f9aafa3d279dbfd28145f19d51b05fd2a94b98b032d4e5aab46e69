I"Å<p>Recently I started a new project of making a CSG editor. Or, at least thatâ€™s the very first starting point for the project. I didnâ€™t exactly know how CSG worked before, so I looked into some articles (link). I learned some very cool things, such as what a half-edge data structure is. Previously, it had been a big mystery to me how you would actually implement a 3d modeling operation such as extrusion, bevel, or inserting edge loops, but this very tiny idea really opened things up for me. Itâ€™s all so clear now! You should first read about it here arenâ€™t familiar with it (link). You can trivially convert a half-edge mesh to a more traditional triangle-mesh that youâ€™d feed to the GPU.</p>
